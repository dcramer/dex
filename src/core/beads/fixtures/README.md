# Beads Fixtures

These fixtures are anonymized and derived from real-world Beads state.

## Files

- `basic.jsonl` - small representative sample for smoke tests
- `graph.jsonl` - includes parent-child and blocks relationships
- `edge-cases.jsonl` - includes non-ideal relationships (e.g. missing targets)

## Generation

Initial generation was done via a one-off agent prompt to pull all local Beads
state and anonymize it
