  "context": "Define the StorageEngine interface that all storage backends will implement.\n\nWhat it does:\n- Abstract interface for storage operations\n- Allows swapping between file, GitHub Issues, GitHub Projects v2\n\nImplementation:\n- Create src/core/storage-engine.ts\n- Define interface with methods:\n  - read(): TaskStore\n  - write(store: TaskStore): void\n  - getPath(): string (or getIdentifier for non-file backends)\n- Export interface\n\nDone when:\n- Interface file created with all methods defined\n- Exported from src/core/storage-engine.ts\n- No breaking changes to existing code yet",
  "priority": 1,
  "status": "completed",
  "result": "Created StorageEngine interface:\n\nImplementation:\n- Created src/core/storage-engine.ts with interface defining read(), write(), getIdentifier()\n- Interface provides abstraction for file, GitHub Issues, and GitHub Projects v2 backends\n- Documented each method with JSDoc including error conditions\n- Used getIdentifier() instead of getPath() for backend-agnostic naming\n\nAll tests passing, ready for implementations.",
