  "context": "Rename and refactor current TaskStorage class to implement the StorageEngine interface.\n\nWhat it does:\n- Make current file-based storage implement the interface\n- Maintain all existing functionality\n- No behavioral changes, just structural\n\nImplementation:\n- Rename TaskStorage class to FileStorage in src/core/storage.ts\n- Add 'implements StorageEngine' to class declaration\n- Ensure all interface methods are implemented\n- Update imports in task-service.ts\n- Keep all existing logic (git root detection, migration, etc.)\n\nDone when:\n- Class renamed to FileStorage\n- Implements StorageEngine interface\n- All existing tests pass without modification\n- TaskService still works with FileStorage",

  "result": "Refactored TaskStorage to FileStorage implementing StorageEngine:\n\nImplementation:\n- Renamed TaskStorage class to FileStorage in src/core/storage.ts\n- Added 'implements StorageEngine' to class declaration\n- Renamed getPath() to getIdentifier() to match interface\n- Added deprecated getPath() method for backward compatibility\n- Exported TaskStorage as alias for FileStorage\n- Updated TaskService to accept StorageEngine interface\n- TaskService constructor now accepts StorageEngine | string for flexibility\n- Updated imports in task-service.ts\n\nBackward compatibility:\n- Tests still use TaskStorage (alias) and getPath() - all passing\n- Existing code continues to work without changes\n\nAll 60 tests passing. FileStorage is ready as base implementation.",
